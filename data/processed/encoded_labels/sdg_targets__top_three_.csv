2006,the cape floristic region cfr biodiversity hotspot is a globally significant repository of biodiversity recognized for its high irreplaceability and vulnerability the hotspot is threatened by a number of humaninduced pressures which are gradually undermining key conservation values the government of south africa has initiated an ambitious and comprehensive longterm programmatic approach to arrest these pressures and protect a representative sample of biodiversity the program known as cape action for people and the environment cape will implement the cape action plan for the environment cape strategy which was endorsed by the government in the cape strategy provides a longterm vision for biodiversity conservation in the cfr and articulates an action plan and investment program to strategically address identified conservation priorities the cape agulhas biodiversity initiative the project comprises one of three complementary gef initiatives in support of the cape program aimed at strengthening systemic institutional and individual capacities and establishing the knowhow for conservation management in different ecological and socioeconomic conditions as needed to attain conservation the agulhas plain constitutes one of the largest extant storehouses of lowland fynbos and threatened renosterveld habitats in the world the diversity of habitat types wetland ecosystems red data plant species and local endemics is unmatched in the cfr the area is currently being threatened by a range of anthropogenic pressures but nevertheless constitutes one of the best opportunities for conserving the cfrs lowland habitats the project would pilot new management measures and institutional arrangements for conservation at a subregional level tied closely to the activities of the productive sectors and rooted in decentralised governance frameworks the following outputs are anticipated i an innovative model is developed tying management of a mosaic of protected areas on public and private lands with production systems on neighbouring farmsteads the government of south africa intends to replicate the model in other protected areas in the cfr and elsewhere where decentralised conservation approaches are urgently needed the project is expected to make a significant contribution to enhancing the sustainability of the national system of protected areas ii ecologically socially and ethically sustainable harvesting of wild fynbos demonstrated as a viable land use iii participatory and responsible tourism strategy implemented in the agulhas plain and contributes to sustainable livelihoods and iv increased local support for biodiversity conservation in the agulhas plain is generated through an informal awareness program conservation actions

compared to at project start a fivefold increase in current employment in communitybased tourism activities on the plain by the end of year nb through consultation with the tourism stakeholders and working group the mte found that the indicator which deals with livelihoods is not realistic or achievable as clear baseline figures and tools of measurement are not in place as yet however once the tourism strategy and economic flow study is completed it would be more realistic to measure livelihoods all tourism operators in protected areas are applying responsible tourism guidelines by year nb mte found that the indicator which deals with responsible tourism guidelines is not realistic or achievable the indicator will be reconsidered once the tourism strategy and economic flow studies are completed increased positive coverage in the media by the end of year please note this indicator and the following indicator were misnumbered in previous pirs this was previously though there had been no the error is now corrected all decisionmakers and more than of the general public in agulhas plain are aware of the value of biodiversity and are actively involved in conservation related

2204,the government of south africa has developed the cape action for people and environment cape programme to protect the rich biological heritage of the cape floristic region cfr and to ensure that biodiversity conservation is mainstreamed into economic development and poverty alleviation strategies the basis for this programme was laid by global environment facility gef support in september in this period the cape action plan for the environment referred to as the cape strategy was developed it identified the key ecological patterns and processes which need to be conserved in the cfr the key threats and root causes of biodiversity losses to be addressed to conserve the cfr this resulted in a spatial plan identifying the priority areas for conservation intervention and a series of systemic programme activities to be undertaken over a year period to conserve the cfr the cape programme is being implemented over a year period through phases phase and will seek incremental funding from the gef phase will seek lower levels of gef resources and phase will be funded from domestic resources each phase of the programme is designed as a relatively discrete element generating defined global environmental benefits the overall purpose of the project is to conserve and manage the natural environment of the cfr and adjacent marine environment it will also deliver significant benefits to the people of the region in a way that is embraced by local communities endorsed by government and recognised internationally the united nations development programme undp and the world bank wb are

2762,madagascar is recognized as one of the greatest megadiversity hotspots in the world for biodiversity but conservation of biodiversity outside of its protected area network remains highly problematic protected areas are increasingly becoming islands surrounded by fields grasslands and severely degraded natural areas transfer of natural resource management rights to empowered communities was begun under madagascars second environment programme this shows great promise but participatory and sustainable management of ecosystems and natural resources is severely constrained by the lack of viable sustainable natural resource models and the lack of economic incentives to communities for sustainable managementthe project will address systemic institutional and individual barriers to sustainable natural resources management snrm working first at communitybased field laboratories in protected area support zones pasz to develop replicable productive snrm models secondly

3447,the economic value of the ecosystem services generated by the natural resources of the congo river basin is immense and the economic costs and losses incurred through ecosystem degradation and loss are therefore substantial such costs have far reaching implications both for national efforts at sustainable economic development and poverty alleviation and for economic processes in other parts of the world such high values strongly imply a high economic and development value to protected area pa conservation in the region in many cases this value far exceeds those arising from alternative and less sustainable land and resource use options increasing global recognition of the value of ecosystem services together with the development of mechanisms such as redd aimed at their monetisation are creating new opportunities for capturing and conserving the congo basin s natural values marginal benefits from investing in capital improvements and ongoing management of protected areas particularly beginning from current low levels of investment are therefore likely to be very high however current spending levels are low management effectiveness of existing spending is low and countries are lacking models and tools to take advantage of new opportunities to improve the situation all elements of pa financial sustainability measured in each country in the region were found to be operating at a suboptimal level ie they presented some kind of barrier to sustainable pa financing the project design calls for utilising gef funding to address barriers to pa financial sustainability within six congo basin countries according to this demonstration approach approaches to removal of individual barriers would be demonstrated in one or more countries and at pilot pas with the resulting lessons captured and shared at national and regional levels and made available for replication this approach will be further strengthened through a strong reliance on partnerships with donors and other stakeholders across the region that are active in support to pas andor pa finance as a means of covering more ground and stimulating replication in this way the project offers a comprehensive yet realistic approach to the challenge of sustainable pa financing across the region and thus provides tangible support to the regional plan de convergence the present project proposal

3515,the aim of the project is to avoid the co emissions maximizing electric power generation in sugarcane mills using trash and bagasse as fuels substituting the implementation of the corresponding power in thermal generation using fossil fuels especially natural gas electric power will be generated in conventional systems boilersteamturbine systems ôçô preferably to bar boiler and cest ôçô condensing extraction steam turbine with the use of sugarcane trash as a supplementary fuel to bagasse making possible with this extra fuel to have year round generation season and offseason power purchase agreement will be considered with the energy sold to the final consumer what would be possible with year round generation getting better prices for the electricity the project will consider the study for a group of sugarcane mills with the purpose of implementing the project in at least mills with very good perspectives that the technology will be replicated in the near future the implementation of the project in this mills will lead to a total of t of co displacement per year using natural gas generation as baseline when the mills reach of the total trash recovery considering average of million tons of milled cane per implemented project mill the project considers the study and implementation of the alternative of ôç whole material harvestingôçø that considers the transport of trash with the cane in total the equipment for this alternative permits also the operation in the ôç partial cleaningôçø mode for particular situations when it is necessary to leave some trash in the field for agronomic purposes this can be performed just by adequate operation of the harvester extracting part of the trash from the harvested material and leaving it in the field the main difference in trash cost of the alternatives of ôç whole material harvestingôçø and ôç partial cleaningôçø us and us per ton of trash dry matter respectively is due to the greater amount of trash with the cane present in the first which reduces significantly cane load density increasing transport costs the project has the proposition to solve or minimize this problem reducing significantly trash cost for the whole material harvesting alternative on the other hand the ôç whole material harvestingôçø alternative has higher recovery efficiency than the ôç partial cleaningôçø alternative bringing therefore more trash to the mill besides that partial cleaning has the disadvantage that in the cleaning process the part of the trash that is removed and left in the field is the driest and easiest to separate and that would be the best to be burned at the boilers the interesting point of these two options is that the field operations are almost the same as for actual sugarcane harvesting with no specific operations for trash recovery there is the need to adaptmodify the cane harvester to the condition of no cleaning or partial cleaning the infield transport equipment and road truck fleet would be modified and its number increased with the purpose of transporting a greater material volume but no significant change in operations timing management type of equipment and maintenance would occur in summary trash would be harvested with the cane the main investment in terms of trash recovery and processing would be performed at the mill site where a dry cleaning station for trash and mineral separation from cane and a trash shredding equipment would be necessary the project should provide the means for the development of new equipment that are not available today because no one is recovering trash in these systems whole material harvesting or partial cleaning actuating in several fronts to break technological and risk barriersto create the conditions for sugar mills to increase the export of electricity generated by sugar cane trash and bagasse to the grid technology for sugarcane trash collection and conversion to exported electricity at sugarcane mills is commercially launched economic and financial viability of sugarcane trash collection and utilization for export of electricity from sugarcane mills is commercially demonstrated environmental integrity of the use of biomass for energy is assured dissemination capacity building replication strategy across the sugar cane sector is under implementation institutional legal regulatory framework is in place to promote the sustainable use of biomass for electricity generation and sales to the grid economic feasibility of increased generation with trash is demonstrated environmental and legal

4490,the government of kenya has made significant investments in most protected areas pas in the country however despite the high returns from wildlife based tourism and the large baseline of investment in protected area management in kenya conflicting interests between conservation and development persist in the greater amboseli landscape where the ecological viability of the pa estate to sustain healthy populations of wildlife is threatened by loss of animal dispersal areas migratory corridors and drought refugia the greater amboseli landscape is part of the maasai lands of the southern kenya rangelands where communities continue to experience conservation in terms of protectionism and a segregation approach contrary to their preferred approach of integration of people and natureto deliver both development and conservation benefits the longterm solution proposed by this project is to conserve the amboseli landscape s threatened species and habitats and especially the charismatic elephants and expansive swamps and simultaneously promote sustainable development of the ecosystem for the benefit of the present and future generations the amboseli landscape has little arable potential but it has enormous national and global heritage and tourism value which pas alone cannot secure in the long term the solution to the conservation challenge lies in embracing a landscape approach to conservation and development allowing the ecosystem to provide a broad range of benefits and services to the broad range of interests dependent on it including wildlife pastoralists offsite communities water and indeed the environment this will only be achieved if there is meaningful involvement of the local communities in the landscape approach given the better legacy of coexistence over millennia of joint use of the land this proposed project in the greater amboseli landscape in kenya satisfies the requirements for gef financing under gef biodiversity focal area strategic objective one improve sustainability of protected area systems and two mainstream biodiversity conservation and sustainable use into production landscapes it will provide a resource governance model that allows communities and conservationists to utilise revitalised skills and guided by a knowledge based landscape planning take advantage of modified policies and market based incentives to balance resource use and resource conservation across the greater amboseli to secure a broader range of benefits for the onsite and offsite dependents in a more equitable and sustainable manner the project partners kenya wildlife service maasai wilderness conservation trust african conservation centre big life and nature kenya will according to designated roles and responsibilities support national efforts to secure conservancy management set up a series of conservancies across the landscape map out and secure wildlife dispersal areas secure connectivity corridors between the

4493,charcoal is the preferred cooking energy in uganda particularly by urban consumers because of a variety of reasons including it is affordable by all cadres of society and the only option available for the many low waged urban employees it is substantially more efficient than wood and burns with very limited smoke it has highenergy content per unit weight it has a higher energy density than wood it is easier to transport than wood and can be easily transported to markets far away from the forest as a result many people consider charcoal a relatively modern fuel rather than a traditional one government statistics attests to this according to uganda bureau of statistics the total nominal value of household consumption of firewood and charcoal increased by from ushs billion in to ushs billion in the value of charcoal consumption more than doubled while the value of firewood consumption increased by for the same period notwithstanding its popularity the charcoal subsector remains plagued by inefficient production practices lack of sustainable supplies of woody biomass and inadequate often conflicting policy statements at this rate the pressure on natural resources will be exacerbated even further as communities produce more charcoal to meet their livelihood demands and urban charcoal consumer demand the overall goal of this project is improved charcoal production technologies and sustainable land management practices through an integrated approach in uganda the objective of the project is to secure multiple environmental benefits by addressing the twin

convention are found here these are extraordinarily biodiversity rich ecosystems also provide essential services for local livelihoods and for national development this project has been designed to engineer a paradigm shift to manage wetland pa sites and activities in the immediate landscapes to address both direct threats to biodiversity at the wetland sites and those emanating from the landscape this is because wetland pas compared to other terrestrial pas are more likely to be impacted from activities outside their borders such as through water abstraction and pollution which can undermine ecosystem functions vital to the pas it will also establish two new protected areas covering globally important wetland sites and ensure their management to be effectively embedded into sustainable management of linked landscapes in doing so the project is consistent with biodiversity focal area objective improve sustainability of pa systems and outcome improved management

national portfolio formulation exercise for the use of gef star resources wetland conservation has also been noted as a priority due to the immeasurable social economic cultural and environmental benefits to the country including water storage and replenishment and for the sustenance of economically important inland fisheries the importance of wetlands is recognised in the biodiversity law of that has explicitly called for the creation of wetland protected areas and their management through the ministry of natural resources and environment the project is clearly aligned with this law and will pioneer the application of the associated decree no ndcp on guiding implementation of the biodiversity law and decree no ndcp on the conservation and sustainable development of wetland areas since the viet nam nbsap has identified the need for wetland conservation and tam giang hai as a priority wetland area for conservation an additional new protected area sites are indicative and will be confirmed during full project preparation based on global importance additionally the project is also aligned with priorities identified in viet nam national action plan on biodiversity by and orientations towards specifically increase the total area of wetlands and marine reserves of national and international importance and develop adopt and implement master plans on wetland and

4570,kiribati is a nation comprised of atolls inhabited spread across a vast pacific ocean territory the people of rural kiribati are largely reliant upon a limited land base and coastal zone fisheries for both nutrition and livelihood as the population grows and climate change advances the security of island resources will be challenged already the ecosystem integrity upon which islanders depend for climate change resilience is being eroded this is evinced by many factors including deteriorating quality of nearshore fisheries degraded lagoon health and reduced freshwater quality the primary reason for this is that current management regimes for both atoll and lagoon resources are defined by open resource access there is very little active management research andor regulation to make certain use of lagoon resources is maintained within sustainable limits the nation has very little experience with the design and implementation of communitybased management regimes to incentivize improved and more innovative management techniques there are few tools in place to support better management of lagoon resource in light of expanding economic use and demand for these resources this situation challenges resource management both within the lagoon and on the atoll climate change will certainly exacerbates an already very high level of vulnerability the project objective is to build the adaptive capacity of vulnerable kiribati communities to ensure food security under conditions of climate change to address these challenges and reach the projectâ s objective the ldcf investment will support the realization of two components and related activities both components will be closely aligned so that national and sitebased activities are designed to build synergies increase awareness and generate much more informed and strategic use of natural resources so that ecosystem integrity is able to continue to function as the foundation of food security needs under component one the project will assist kiribati to address urgent institutional capacity building needs primarily on the national level this will include helping to set in place an improved regulatory environment strengthened institutional planning and policy frameworks and generation of data required to support informed decisionmaking under component two the project will assist kiribati to address climate change vulnerabilities by implementing and demonstrating communitybased adaptation measures the project will work on a select number of atolls to set in place models for land and lagoon resources management that is predicated upon informed planning and management processes the general awareness of rural communities regarding fisheries management and climate change impacts will be increased communitybased monitoring systems will be established this will be used to inform decisionmaking serve as an early warning system for climate change impacts and be linked to islandwide vulnerability assessments the monitoring system will be linked to national level programming so that national level decisionmaking benefits from more broadbased information sources the project will support the generation adoption and implementation of model council bylaws designed to be ecosystem inclusive and enhance ecosystem integrity this will include model regulations for the management of fisheries including permit and reporting mechanisms for both subsistence commercial and tourism use of lagoon resources the project will work with extension officers responsible for both agriculture and fisheries resources this will include building the capacities of officers responsible government agencies island councils and rural stakeholders through formal training programs utilizing fisheries field schools model programs for more sustainable and climate resilient practices will be tested assessed and ready for national replication all project activity will target the reduction of

4605,brief description as per census of the billion people in india million live in rural areas although a majority of rural households depend on farm income small land holding and low agricultural productivity make it necessary for farmers to look for additional sources of income it is estimated that nearly half of india s rural households are poor in terms of insecure livelihoods options lack of access to reliable affordable and clean energy plagues most rural livelihoods sectors in india in recent years a systematic effort to promote rural livelihoods has been undertaken in india the focus of these efforts is mostly on horticulture dairy poultry fisheries handicrafts and a range of other cottage village industries etc achieving higher and stable productivity in these rural livelihood sectors generally requires access to a reliable energy supply electric mechanical and or thermal however a large proportion of indian rural livelihood locations are unserved or underserved with the necessary reliable energy for improving rural livelihoods in particular grid electricity and lpg to obtain a reliable electricity supply many rural livelihoods enterprises turn to expensivetooperate diesel generators biomass fuels are also becoming expensive renewable energy can provide a more affordable and reliable alternative to diesel generators and inefficient biomass use for rural livelihoods enterprises the proposed project aims at demonstrating and developing the market for renewable energy technology packages for rural livelihoods retprls in three selected states assam odisha and madhya pradesh the project will work with carefully chosen retprls for an initial group of rural districts with a strong unserved and underserved energy supply situation for key

4656,the seychelles pa system currently consists of pas terrestrial marine and combined totalling ha in government announced its intent to gazette new areas in the outer islands the gazetting of three new areas in the inner islands of them privately owned is underway the only privately owned island group in the outer islands is also seeking pa status this expands the pa system to ha almost tripling the gazetted area in addition of the marine area a further sq km is to be protected as a notake zone mostly in nearshore areas this major expansion is to be financed at least in part through a

4674,pakistan is a low forest cover country with only of land area remaining under forest cover hacapita however its great variety reflects the countrys physiographic and climatic contrasts and includes temperate and subtropical coniferous forests scrub forests riverine forests irrigated and linear plantations and mangroves the forests particularly those in the north deliver crucial ecosystem services to the entire country in the form of natural resources timber and nontimber forest products water conservation disaster prevention climate regulation carbon sequestration and harbouring important biodiversity including many globally threatened and endemic species demand for timber and fuel wood have been the main economic drivers for forest management in pakistan these together with severe overgrazing in many areas have led to significant loss and degradation of the forest resource and lack of sustainability pakistans forests which include stateowned communal or privately owned land have already undergone extensive deforestation and remain under severe threat of further deforestation in the order of hayr as a result most forests are modified or seminatural according to the forest resource assessment fao deforestation and forest degradation have caused a reduction of carbon stock in the living above and underground biomass from to million tons from to which is an annual decrease of land use land use change and forestry lulucf is calculated to contribute to pakistans carbon emissions the provincial and other territorial forest departments who are responsible for forest conservation and management do not have adequate capacity and instruments to address deforestation which is illustrated by the recent lifting of the ban on timber trade in gilgitôçôbaltistan the importance of forests in terms of ecosystem services has started to receive attention at the political level the national mdg target of increasing forest cover up to by has driven financial support for central governmentfunded forestry programmes however provincial resources for forestry are limited due to competing demands from agriculture water and sanitation health and education pakistan is a unredd partner country and recently a redd preparedness phase project for pakistan has been initiated by the ministry of climate change with financial support from undp and unredd through oneunjpe us and fao respectively us with technical and implementation support from icimod and wwfpakistan the project will help to shape the institutional and regulatory environment for sfm projects supporting redd initiatives in the country that will preserve forests through private sector led carbon sequestration and carbon credit generation the redd project provides important preconditions to establish pakistanôçös access to the international carbon market in future by the end of the redd strategy project will complete assessments of data availability and capacity needs as well as an action plan for mrv one of the major outputs of the project is developing the redd readiness roadmap for pakistan and a readiness preparation proposal rpp a specific format required by the world banks forest carbon partnership facility fcpf the rpp was submitted to fcpf in july requesting us million funding of a total million project the rpp project document focuses on i preparation of

drivers forest law policy and governance v redd strategy options vi redd implementation framework vii social and environmental impact during readiness preparation and redd implementation viii develop a national forest reference emission level ix design system for national forest monitoring and information on safeguards and x design a programme monitoring and evaluation framework the redd readiness roadmap is planned to be ready by end and redd capacity building will continue in redd activities have the potential to deliver significant social and environmental cobenefits however many participants during the early information sharing and dialogues have also highlighted the potential risks particularly for forestdependent communities strategic environmental and social issues which must be considered at the redd readiness stage includes biodiversity and ecosystem services microclimate water services and quality soil condition food security placement of people and fauna cultural and social problems resulting from migration and immigration land ownership land tenure land accessibility energy supply and gender equity and other benefits to improve education and health of the people while pursuing growth with low emissions from land use change pakistan forest management is decentralized and governed at provincial level which will probably facilitate processes leading to ownership and control of forest resources but it complicates transfer of knowledge and access to global facilities including the carbon market and fora for sfm in anticipation of the development of the carbon market private companies have started to search opportunities to invest in redd projects these companies sometimes offer millions of dollars to forest managers in return for contracts covering large areas of land this phenomenon has raised the forest managers eagerness for redd but the reliability and integrity of the redd companies is not always evident forest managers lack the proper knowledge and experience with redd for an adequate response to the advances by these companies and it is clear that framing of this development into policies and regulations is required as well as successful demonstration of landscapescale sfm activities on the ground this project has therefore been designed to fit seamlessly with and support pakistanôçös redd initiative whilst the rpp will support preparation of the federal and provincial level strategic and policy framework and national level methodologies and capacities for redd implementation this project will take pakistans unredd readiness programme to a practical level through demonstration of sustainable forest management at landscape scale raising readiness for trading forest emissions reductions in markets and reducing losses of forest cover through enabling further upscaling of good practice the project will focus on three target forested landscapes totalling ha where participatory sustainable forest management approaches will be implemented to secure globally significant biodiversity carbon benefits and other forest ecosystem services in an integrated way this will be the first time that such an approach has been piloted at such a scale and will provide a vital base for capacity building knowledge sharing and upscaling a key element of the project will be to demonstrate financial sustainability for forest management through effective business planning and a variety of funding mechanisms it will enhance the momentum of the redd initiative and pave the ground for full redd implementation recognising that it may take several years before private sector led carbon sequestration and carbon credit generation are sufficient to deliver sfm in pakistan without the project successful demonstration of this landscapescale approach to sustainable forest management would probably not take place for many years putting at risk the success of the un redd implementation in pakistan as a result critical forest landscapes of high biodiversity and carbon significance will continue to face the threat of habitat destruction and loss of globally important species and ecosystems and the

4719,since south africa has made major strides in protecting its biodiversity having instituted extensive policy reforms and created new institutions at national and provincial levels to manage biodiversity there is a need to strike a balance between shortterm acceleration of employment opportunities and conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity coordinating and supporting the capacity of municipalities to deliver is key to successful realization of the new growth path there are several challenges to achieving this first capacity at the municipal scale is very weak and there is little or no coordination amongst the myriad of institutions that regulate land use second less than of land in south africa is formally protected which leaves critical biodiversity under threat from degradation and conversion pressure in the absence of effective community based natural resource management last but not least the potential contribution of biodiversity to the government jobs agenda is not yet clear and thus there is little or no incentive for municipalities to work with landholders to manage land and natural resources in a biodiversity friendly manner this project is designed to address these challenges by a a strengthening coordination and capacity of municipal and other regulatory authorities that regulate land use decisions within municipalities to incorporate criteria to mitigate and offset impacts on biodiversity over and above statutory environments for environmental protection b putting in place a cooperative governance framework in partnership with private and communal land owners to better manage land including providing incentives for landholders to engage in biodiversity friendly practices while also demonstrating the potential of biodiversity to create jobs and contribute to economic growth the project will work in three district municipalities in global biodiversity hotspots and with very high rates of habitat degradation and

4904,the production and trade in charcoal has been a massive rural growth industry over the past decade in sierra leone a minority urban fuel during the s and s it has gradually displaced firewood and is now the fuelwood of choice for the majority of urban residents because it is affordable by all cadres of society and the only option available for the many low waged urban employees it is substantially more efficient than wood and burns with very limited smoke and less fire hazard preferred by landlords and it has higher calorific value and easier to transport than wood as a result many people consider charcoal a relatively modern fuel when burn on the modern stoves notwithstanding its popularity the charcoal and cookstoves subsector remains informal unregulated and fragmented plagued by inefficient production system relying on nonrenewable sources supported by incoherent and often conflicting policy statements harvesting of wood for charcoal differs considerably to firewood as charcoal wood supplies are often obtained from forests and woodlands rather than farms this is because in many of the higher production level villages charcoal production conducted in addition to farming instead of farming as the trade has become lucrative enough for some villages that they have been able to give up their reliance on agriculture and purchase all household supplies from charcoal production income at this rate the pressure on natural resources will be exacerbated even further as communities produce more charcoal to meet their livelihood demands and urban charcoal consumer demand it is worth noting however that one immediately evident issue is that some charcoal producers specifically target hardwood species of high commercial export value resulting in an economically inefficient use of forest resources interventions should avoid trying to fundamentally change how the fuelwood industry operates but instead solutions should be focused on making the trade and business more efficient resilient and sustainable by incentivizing all value chain actors as inclusive business objectives of the project the overall goal of this project is energy efficient production and utilization of charcoal through innovative technologies and private sector involvement in sierra leone the objective of the project is to bring economic social and environmental benefits through the production of certified charcoal from sustainably sourced feedstock and through the promotion of improved cookstoves to reduce fuel wood demand improve health and reduce

5029,the development challenge targeted by the present project involves the need for indonesia to define plan for and create a better balance between the development and management of major estate crops such as rubber coffee and oil palm and the need for improved forest protection the project thus focuses on creating more effective land allocations and management of forest areas with high biodiversity and ecosystem services in the context of potential estate crop development in kalimantan and particularly in the heart of borneo hob area competing priorities between the country s targeted increase in palm oil production and associated growth and employment targets for the sector need to be reconciled with commitments at both national and international levels to reducing rates of deforestation forest fires and associated ghg emissions and biodiversity loss the project strategy and theory of change is based on carrying out a clear process of identifying priority locations and testing approaches where enhanced forest area planning management and associated use of incentives can be used to generate national and global incremental benefits without harming the potential for economic growth and development of the relevant kalimantan provinces associated with increased production of estate crops in addition to providing extensive benefits to kalimantan including the hob area the nationallevel policies and tools to be developed by the project will also be of significant potential value to other areas of indonesia facing similar development challenges the strategy is focused on developing and implementing various approaches to enhancing protection of forested areas in the nonforest land and in the convertible forest both of which are subject to potential conversion administratively andor physically to estate crops despite their remaining forest covermaintaining forest areas including the biodiversity and ecosystem functions of kalimantan s lowland and

5079,the souss massa drâa smd region in the southwest of morocco represents an important and vulnerable part of morocco s share in the mediterranean biodiversity hotspot however in recent decades rapid population growth and the evolving aspirations of its people have led to increasing pressure on the integrity of the region s ecosystems and their services the unique and globally important forests of argan tree argania spinosa the vast majority of global argan exists in morocco and is located in the smd are currently under severe threat from a wide range of human exploitation activities within morocco the overall cover of argan forests has been reduced by an estimated over the last years and an average ha still continue to be lost each year the remaining forests are increasingly degraded with very little natural regeneration taking place even though demand for the highlyvalued oil from the argan fruit has significantly increased in recent years the long term solution that this project proposes is to introduce the payment for ecosystem services pes as an innovative mechanism to reverse the loss and degradation of the globally important argan ecosystem in combination with an enhanced valuation of key products from this ecosystem argan oil and honey through improved labelling and marketing by introducing pes for the first time to morocco the project would also contribute to laying a solid foundation for this strategic landuse and conservation tool in the country as a whole the project aims to achieve its objective through four interconnected outcomes outcome will facilitate the creation of an enabling environment for the introduction of pes in morocco by focussing on the institutional policy and legal changes needed to support the establishment and piloting of such a mechanism in the smd region outcome will strengthen technical capacities for the implementation of pes schemes in the smd region and prepare the ground for national level upscaling of pes concepts and tools by means of outreach the dissemination of lessons learned and the exchange of experiences with other ongoing programs and projects outcome will promote organic and biodiversityfriendly businesses through the improved labelling and marketing of agrobiodiversity products from the argan ecosystem while ensuring the sustainability of related production systems by

5140,costa rica is already experiencing the effects of climate change cc principally in the northern region of the country cc scenarios suggest that by the annual area rainfall will be reduced by up to in the region in the short term rainfall is predicted to decrease by and by these extreme conditions will exacerbate climate and water stress in some areas recreating conditions that are typical of semiarid areas if ccdriven pressures are not addressed the region will continue to experience significant water shortages that will have a severe economic impact on the livelihoods of local communities and the productive sectors in costa rica rural aqueduct associations asadas which are locally organized groups of men and women from the usercommunities delegated by the national institute of aqueducts and sewers aya provide potable water and sanitation services to of the country s population reaching communities in suburban and rural areas most asadas in the region must develop the necessary skills and have access to knowledge and tools as well as adequate investment in order to address the scarcity of the water supply due to cc existing aqueduct infrastructure is often outdated and overloaded causing inefficient water delivery which in turn complicates the collection of fees from end users instability of fee collection leads to financial uncertainty which impedes the asadas and the aya s ability to plan for and implement targeted improvements and new investments including adaptation to cc aya investment plans lack communitybased or ecosystembased adaptation measures if the asadas do not strengthen their capacities to cope with cc the vulnerability of rural populations of the northern region of costa rica will only increase the longterm solution to mitigate the prevailing threats of water shortages to local livelihoods is to establish a holistic approach to managing the water supply and demand that takes cc into account the objective of this fiveyear project is to improve water supply and promote sustainable water practices of end users and productive sectors by advancing community and ecosystembased adaptation measures in asadas to address projected climaterelated hydrological vulnerability in northern costa rica this will be achieved through community and ecosystembased measures in rural aqueduct associations asadas to address projected climaterelated hydrological vulnerability the interventions are targeted in the northern region of costa rica guanacaste and alajuela provinces however the following barriers limit the achievement of the normative solution a lack of knowledge and acces to finance for resilient infrastructure efficient householdlevel water use technologies and aquifer mapping to effectively manage water demand and usage and design strategies to conserve water during periods of drought b limited capacity and knowledge among local stakeholders to adopt sustainable water use practices and reduce their vulnerability to cc c incomplete hydroclimatological network and deficient climate early warning and information system cews that limit the ability of rural asadas and local communities to implement timely mitigation measures d lack of awareness among policy and decisionmakers about the social economic and environmental implications of water resources vulnerability to cc and e lack of economic

5176,in the upper niger river basin where poverty is prevalent and the economy is based on agriculture ecosystem services sustain the livelihoods of more than half a million people ecosystems provide these local communities with food shelter fiber firewood and medicinal plants climate change affecting the upper niger basin will result in higher temperatures increased evapotranspiration and changes in the rainfall regime these conditions will threaten the continued stream of benefits from ecosystem services particularly with respect to water security it will also increase the risk of bushfire communities whose livelihoods depend on ecosystems services and who live close to fireprone areas are the most vulnerable in the baseline scenario investments in watershed management are limited and generally not climateproof also under the current level of threat linked to prevailing land use practices ecosystems that had maintained resilience in function and structure are gradually degrading although there is a strong baseline investment in rural development programmes if climate change adaptation is not part of development efforts this globallevel threat will constitute an overriding stressor that will push ecosystems beyond their tipping point this project addresses the additional risk posed by climate change to vulnerable communities in the upper niger river basin through an ecosystembased approach it enhances ecosystems resilience across the landscape as a climate change adaptation measure and with a clear additionality visavis the baseline it focuses on watershed management and landuse practices on the ground the project also builds the capacity of relevant stakeholders to change land use practices and adapt to a climatically challenging future in this manner target communities who depend on ecosystem services for their livelihoods will become more resilient to climate change since there is no development plan at the regional and departmental level in guinea the project will mainly focus on introducing adaptation priorities into local planning and budgeting processesto reduce the vulnerability of local communities in the upper niger river basin to the additional risks posed by climate change and build their general resilience through an ecosystembased approach that focuses on watersheds landuse practices and adaptive capacity the climate

5178,the coastal zone of sierra leone is highly vulnerable to the increased frequency and severity of coastal erosion flooding and storm surges which severely impact social wellbeing health livelihood security and water resources and major economic sectors such as fishing tourism water resources and agriculture coastal communities are already experiencing considerable repercussions of these impacts notably on their livelihoods with reduced fishing productivity ecosystem degradation and low farming outputs the limited accessibility of climaterelated data limits the ability of decisionmakers to make informed planning and policy decisions for the coast in particular marine and sea parameters databases such as wave height wave period wind speed and direction and to take any clear strategic actions to remedy these negative effects this indequate lack of knowledge is contributing towards undermining social and economic development particularly under a changing climate through this

5189,country profile the republic of djibouti is a small multiethnic nation of over inhabitants lies in northeast africa on the gulf of aden at the southern entrance to the red sea with a land area of about km the small country has experienced exceptional economic growth in recent years still it has one of the lowest human development index ratings nd of countries and the lowest among the arab states the country is affected by poverty food insecurity malnutrition and limited access to services and is vulnerable to climate changeinduced risks the pressure from the migrant and refugee populations strains its limited resources and infrastructure the development situation in rural areas is compounded by fragile ecosystems vulnerability to climate change and water scarcity poor soil limited vegetation low rainfall and rising temperatures constrain agricultural development and aggravate dependency on imports of basic goods they also threaten cattle production and the livelihoods of smallscale farmers and herders especially women imf report surface water resources are extremely limited and underground water requires intensive extraction the nomadic populations in djibouti and the neighbouring countries must move over increasing distances often across borders in search of pasture disrupting social cohesion and traditional mechanisms of dispute and conflict resolution the use of firewood by rural communities without access to modern clean energy sources exacerbates the pressure on fragile ecosystems the coastal areas where per cent of the population live host critical biological diversity and marine ecosystems that are at risk in the absence of protection and sustainable management climate change has eroded communities resilience world bank and reduced opportunities for sustainable development as noted by djibouti s second national communication on the united nations framework convention on climate change the country may see a celsius temperature rise and up to a per cent reduction in rainfall by in recognition of its climate vulnerability the country developed national adaptation plan and submitted its nationally determined contributions to implement the paris agreement setting its vision for climate action and calling for approximately billion in new investments the priority is to address increased exposure to droughts and floods to reduce social vulnerability and damage to physical assets and sources of livelihoods impacts from erratic rainfall are intensified in upland regions where severe flood events cause significant erosion and damage to livelihoods at the national level the absence of a national climate change strategy and institutional mechanisms to promote crosssectoralcrossministerial coordination and to mobilise funds hampers efforts to address longterm climaterelated risks in rural regions at regional and local levels particularly in remote mountain regions communities lack the financial technical and informational resources needed to build their resilience to climate change as well as the knowledge of how to prepare for extreme weather impacts as climate change evolves and floods and droughts become more severe and frequent in djibouti there is a need to identify approaches for reducing the vulnerability of farmers and pastoralists to rainfall variability project description in consultation with the national counterpart for the project the ministry of habitat urbanism and environment djibouti the project steering committee selected two mountainous location to implement the project namely adaillou and assamo areas the geographical location selection was based on integrated criteria of vulnerability to climate change and the potential for scale up of the project investments and technical support to maximaiz ethe impact of the project these included the current poverty rate and the potential for incomegenerating activities in the targeted communities the availability of surface water and harvesting storage potential the potential for agropastoral development the extend of extreme vulnerability of the populations to climate change and a demonstrable

through the development of national adaptation programme of actions as well as through progress on poverty reduction and millennium development goal gains over the last decade in the context of climate change these countries now need to consider medium to longterm planning within the framework of national priorities for low emissions and climate resilient development so as to align and sustain growth and poverty reduction the national adaptation plan nap process is one of several processes established to address this need parties have established that the nap process is to be countrydriven continuous participatory progressive and iterative the process will enable ldcs to identify finance and implement appropriate medium to longterm adaptation needs and to balance sectoral and crosssectoral priorities at national subnational and local levels importantly the medium to longterm adaptation planning underpinning the naps should be multistakeholder oriented and based on and guided by the best available science rigorous collection and analysis of appropriate data and consideration of experiences and good practices within and outside countries at present ldcs are implementing urgent and immediate adaptation needs with most focusing on sector specific interventions ldcs do not have access to wellorganised knowledge to inform climate resilient planning processes and the required medium to longterm and crosssectoral planning is seldom undertaken ldcs do not have the required institutional structures and technical capacity for initiating a functional crosssectoral and iterative nap process a request was consequently made at the durban cop for united nations agencies to consider support mechanisms to assist ldcs to advance their nap processes the preferred solution is to strengthen appropriate existing institutional frameworks technical expertise managerial capacity and decisionmaking processes within ldcs to facilitate the nap process this undpunep programme financed by the ldcf will consequently establish a support mechanism around three main pillars institutional support technical support and knowledge brokering the goal of this programme is to support ldcs to commence a process of integrating medium to longterm planning for adaptation to climate change within or aligned with current development planning and budgeting processes this will ensure that a successful nap is not a standalone document but will lead to the integration of adaptation into the existing mainstream development and poverty reduction plans and budgets of a particular country the programme will strengthen institutional and technical capacities in all ldcs for iterative development of comprehensive naps that are countrydriven and based on existing national development priorities and strategies and processes the programme goal and objective will be achieved by i developing operational and flexible nap papers and implementing training to

5263,the project is designed to strengthen conservation management capabilities across the multiuse atsimoandrefana spiny and dry forest landscape straddling an area of some million hectares the landscape harbours spiny thickets and dry forests that rank amongst the most distinctive yet least protected ecosystems in madagascar it is rich in biodiversity but faces accelerating anthropogenic pressures historically land conversion for subsistence agriculture has comprised the major threat to biodiversity however largescale projects such as road construction irrigation schemes oil gas developments and mining present a future threat opening the landscape to large scale commercial agriculture eg cotton farming open pit mining and other developments which may also lead to an influx of economic migrants these emerging threats are not unique to the target landscape they are likely to prevail to a greater or lesser extent across large swathes of the country however the government lacks an effective management framework for ensuring that such development does not come at an unacceptable price in terms of biodiversity loss there is an urgent unmet need to mainstream biodiversity management into development and to influence the trajectory of development to contain pressures in the most ecologically sensitive areas including protected areas pas their adjacent zones and important ecological corridors the project will address this need through a twopronged approach first it will strengthen resource use governance at the landscape level by developing and implementing a

5363,sumatra is the sixth largest island in the world characterized by the bukit barisan mountain range and globally significant tropical montane sub montane lowland fresh water and peat swamp forests as well as mangroves and rivers the island s fauna includes mammal and bird species with endemic and critically endangered species such as the sumatran orangutan and sumatran rhinoceros and subspecies such as the sumatran elephant the sumatran tiger panthera tigris sumatrae is indonesia s last remaining tiger subspecies with an estimated population of adults its conservation areas include important bird areas two ramsar sites berbak and sembilang national parks and the unesco whc tropical rainforest heritage of sumatra sites the national parks of gunung leuser kerinci seblat and bukit barisan selatan the current project will cover all five of these globally significant sites and surrounding landscapes across sumatra the principal threat to biodiversity is habitat loss and forest degradation with forest cover shrinking from m hectares in to m hectares in with clearance driven by commercial oil palm and timber fibre plantations followed by subsistence agriculture while the main driver of forest degradation has been commercial logging in addition the wildlife trade is a significant pressure on species with an estimated fifty sumatran tigers poached annually between and the main barriers to achieving this vision are weak natural resource governance and limited protected area management capacity poor interagency coordination for wildlife and forest conservation outside of the pas and inadequate financial planning and management for protected areas the longterm solution offered by the project for securing sumatra s forests wildlife and ecosystem services lies in consolidating a network of effectively managed and adequately funded protected areas pas that are supported by complementary actions in the adjacent forests and with multiple stakeholders to achieve sustainably managed landscapes this will require both multiagency partnerships across multiple provinces and sufficient incentives for communities to reduce forest encroachment and illegal hunting of protected species the objective of the project is to enhance biodiversity conservation in priority landscapes in sumatra through adoption of good management practices in protected areas and adjacent production landscapes using tiger recovery as a key indicator of success this will be accomplished through supporting implementation of the national tiger recovery plan which sets out the key elements

5365,brief description land degradation in the philippines is largely caused by the susceptibility of its soils to erosion due to the hilly and mountainous landforms in many parts of the country the widespread clearing of forest lands in steeply sloping and rolling topography leaves the bare soil highly vulnerable to accelerated erosion of topsoil caused by heavy rainfall and consequential erosive force of water runoff the practice of kaingin or shifting cultivation and other forms of unsuitable upland farming in cleared forest areas further worsens the erosion problem and loss of fertile and productive top soils land degradation in the philippines is manifested by i the loss of productive topsoil through water erosion ii loss of soil fertility due to overcultivation iii loss of vegetation cover due to illegal logging and widespread forest tree cutting and iv expansion of slash and burn agriculture in critical slopes other kinds of degradation which cover a relatively smaller part of the landscape include i water logging due to poor drainage and water management ii soil salinization due to overharvesting of ground water near coastal areas and iii soil pollution from excessive pesticide application and contamination by industrial and household wastes the proposed project would focus principally at the systemic and institutional levels and hence strengthen the enabling regulatory institutional and financial framework that would govern efforts to address land degradation in the philippines it will mainstream sustainable land management slm policies and programs into the development plans of lgus through the guidance of government agencies such as department of agriculture department of environment and natural resources department of agrarian reform department of interior and local development and housing and land use regulatory board to strengthen complementation among these government institutions concerned with land degradation and ensure that the incidence and spread of land degradation in vulnerable ecosystems will be avoided andor reduced the project is expected to improve the land productivity and socioeconomic wellbeing of small farmers to achieve this the project will follow a participatory crosssectoral approach involving all the key stakeholders in project design and implementation the promotion of slm measures and technologies for the adoption of vulnerable farming communities will be the focus of the field investments of the project through the establishment of slm demonstration sites farmers will be able to learn and adopt various methods of soil conservation farming and water resources conservation that will improve their crop production and income therefore the project aims to strengthen the slm

5389,the philippines is the worldôçös second largest archipelago country after indonesia and includes more than islands covering km in the westernmost pacific ocean it is one of the worldôçös richest countries biologically the country is one of the few nations that is in its entirety both a hotspot and a megadiversity country placing it among the top priority hotspots for global conservation the island geography the climate and the once extensive areas of rainforest have resulted in a high level of biodiversity endemism in the country at the very least one third of the more than vascular plant species native to the philippines are endemic of the bird species found in the philippines are endemic of the mammal species species of reptiles and of nearly recorded insect species found in the philippines are endemic the endemism is even higher or species for amphibians philippines plays host to endemic fish species with endemic genera of the nearly insect species are aendemic biodiversity loss is a problem of global proportions the worldôçös biodiversity is estimated to be experiencing rates of extinction at least times higher than any time previously in earthôçös history with some species known to be threatened with extinction and many more likely to be threatened barber et al p habitat destruction is identified as the main driver of biodiversity loss to prevent further habitat destruction and conserve biodiversity countries and governments designated national terrestrial and marine protected areas as of january there are nationally designated protected areas in countries and territories included in the world database on protected areas wdpa these areas cover sq km or about per cent of the earthôçös surface this includes both terrestrial and marine protected areas while there has been considerable progress in the growth of protected areas over recent decades there is growing scientific agreement and policy recognition that existing areas are not sufficient to meet the increasing challenges of biodiversity conservation in the philippines where million hectares have been established as protected areas representing of the countryôçös total land area there is agreement among stakeholders that there are huge gaps in coverage and representativeness of the protected area system compared to the extent of identified key biodiversity areas kbas in the country existing protected areas cover only of kbas there are an estimated million of kbas that need to be placed under some form of effective protection filling these gaps only by expanding conventional protected areas is impractical given both the enormous areas to be covered and issues of jurisdiction where about million hectares have been recognized as ancestral domains and an additional million hectares are covered with application for certificates of ancestral domain titles cadts using the national integrated protected areas system nipas approach the legislation required to gazette a protected area takes years to complete unless there are other cost effective ways of accelerating the expansion of conservation coverage it is likely that degradation will cause irreparable damage to these kbas before these can be placed under effective protection resulting in direct loss of philippine endemic biodiversity in order to address this the government through the undpgef supported new conservation areas in the philippines project newcapp has pilot tested the recognition of new and diversified governance regimes in the establishment and management of protected areas one which has gained international recognition is the country effort in documentation mapping and recognition of indigenous community conserved areas iccas in territories occupied by indigenous peoples which have overlaps in biologically significant terrestrial areas estimated to reach about hectares involving cadts in kbas this means that of the entire area of kbas requiring protection falls into territories occupied by indigenous peoples so creating mechanisms for recognition and strengthening of iccas creates the enabling enviornment for a significant contribution to the strategic expansion of the protected area estate to protect globally significant biodiversity through the newcapp the potential for more cost effective expansion and diversification of conservation coverage has been documented with proven co benefits to upholding the rights of indigenous peoples protection of their livelihoods and cultural and spiritual values associated with such iccas in the philippines iccas include sacred sites and natural features indigenous territories cultural landscapes and seascapes they are found in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems in the country the icca sites also represent different biogeographic regions they can be found from the mountain ridges to the coral reefs they provide habitats to a high diversity of flora and fauna as evidenced from the high degree of overlaps between kbas and ancestral domains based on experience from newcapp the indigenous cultural communitiesôçös icc designated iccas can range from their sustainable hunting grounds which are governed by traditional systems of resource use to sacred places and entire forest corridors depending on the value of iccas to a particular icc community by working on several pilot areas newcapp has initiated policy and structural changes such as the inclusion of new forms of protected areas in the national pa system plan that is currently under formulation this has created an opportunity for a significant expansion of the national conservation estate through recognition of iccas which typically coincide with areas of greatest surviving endemism as a result of the work done by newcapp and other partners such as ngos and ncip there is now significant interest from many icc groups to map document and recognize their iccas longterm vision and barriers the longterm vision is to adequately represent the biodiversity of the philippines in its protected area system of which the indigenous peoples and local communities conserved areas and territories form an integral part the barriers to this long term vision are briefly described as follows inconsistent or lack of clear policy to support icca establishment and management policy harmonization is required to ensure existing policies afford ample protection to the iccas and are duly integrated and recognized in local and national planning systems the indigenous peoples rights act ipra provides for the conservation of natural resources as one of the prime objectives in the management of ancestral domains however the iccas do not enjoy the same level of policy protection as protected areas declared under the nipas for example nipas clearly prohibits mining activities within pas as well as the construction of renewable energy plants exceeding megawatts any infrastructure exceeding this capacity should be supported by legislation this is not the case for iccas where in addition to environmental impact study all that is needed is fpic from the community affected the proposed icca bill could strengthen the policy cover for iccas as areas identified for conservation purposes but it does not yet have widespread support and there is a need for advocacy to build consensus around the objectives of the bill other policies such as resource use in ancestral domains land use planning preparation and related laws have fragmented and sometimes contradictory objectives and need to be harmonized to ensure the potential of iccas to effectively contribute to biodiversity conservation and wellbeing of iccs in protected areas established through the nipas there is currently a lack of documentation and recognition of iccas including support to implementation of community conservation plans and providing this recognition would strengthen on the ground protection installing such procedure in the nipas guidelines would ensure all pas covering ancestral domains would have provisions for recognition of the traditional governance mechanisms of iccs in the sustainable management and protection of specific portions of gazetted pas recognition of these traditional practices and resource use policies of the iccs is also absent from formally established pas and should also be clarified through a series of administrative issuances to ensure the iccs are allowed to sustain their practices without being labeled as violating specific provisions of the nipas act lack of capacities of national provincial and local governments to integrate iccas into their existing planning and governance systems at present there is a lack of capacity at all levels to systematically incorporate the mapping documentation and recognition of iccas as part of ancestral domain delineation and management planning as called for in the delineation of certificate of ancestral domain title cadts and ancestral domain sustainable development protection plan adsdpp formulation following the ipra to optimize this potential there is a need to improve the capacities of national government agencies such as ncip provincial and local governments to embed icca procedures into existing systems and provide support to icc groups likewise the capacity of the national icca consortium now on its nascent stage with support from newcapp needs to be strengthened to enable the iccs and ngo support groups to effectively utilize the consortium as the medium for formulating their priority selfdetermined plans and

5433,the objective of the proposed ldcf project is to support resilient agriculture and livelihoods and to mainstream climate risk considerations into national and subnational planning processes so that local communities are less vulnerable to climate change to achieve this overall objective the project is structured around complementary and mutually reinforcing components component will strengthen the capacity of departments and municipalities in the targeted areas as well as of all relevant ministries to fully integrate climate change risks and opportunities in their development planning and budgeting work component will reduce the targeted communities vulnerability to the adverse impacts of climate change by providing technical training and smart investment in productive agriculture infrastructure for water harvest and management as the alteration of rainfall patterns is the main climate change induced risk to benin s mainly rainfed agriculture component will equally improve the targeted communities adaptive capacities by supporting the diversification of their income generating activities the republic of benin is a subsaharan african country of km and close to million inhabitants despite moderate gdp growth of between and annually over the past two decades benin is still a least developed country and poverty remains widespread and on the rise in benin with national poverty rates of in up from in the country s economy relies heavily on agriculture in particular cotton exports which represents one third of the gross domestic product gdp approximately two thirds of the population relies on the agriculture for their livelihood however it is estimated that only of the cultivated area of benin is irrigated and of agricultural production takes place during the wet season the dependence on good weather for sustaining livelihoods makes local communities very vulnerable to current and upcoming climate change impacts in this context the project is proposing effective and efficient measure by building among other things on the significant successes and results of the napa project integrated adaptation program for combating adverse effects of climate change on agricultural production and food security in benin which was implemented in nine pilot sites across benin and resulted in enhanced adaptive capacities of many poor farmers the introduction of adaptation technologies and innovation development using a researchaction approach the proposed project will build on and scale up the positive impacts and the lessons learnt from this innovative approach thereby proposing efficient and effective actions in order to be as effective and efficient as possible the proposed project also i fits in national priorities and answers local needs as identified during the thorough participatory analysis led during the preparatory phase ii builds on and reinforces national and sub national preexisting structures and capacities and iii mainstreams gender in all its activities outputs and outcomes as well as makes sure that all beneficiaries will equally access the project s benefits the project areas for components and cover villages with a

and ouaké in the middle east part of the country these municipalities were chosen as they were in vulnerable agroecological zones three of these municipalities benefited of napa with each of the two villages they comprise benefiting differently from the project in these municipalities the current project will strengthenthe results of napa results by complementing them and scaling them up without carrying out any redundant action the two new municipalities will benefit from the experience acquired though napa the project will be implemented over a period of years and requests a usd grant funding from the gef it has secured cofinancing for usd mainly from the government of beninto support resilient agriculture livelihoods and mainstream climate risk considerations into national and subnational planning processes so that local communities are less vulnerable to climate change climate change and gender are included in development plans at national and subnational levels productive

islands excluding maoré from the project area comoros is a small island developing state sids with a population of and is one of the most densely populated countries in africa being a sids the comoros is characterised by limited resources and poor economic resilience the comorian population is predominantly dependent upon subsistence livelihoods based on traditional crops and reliant upon natural resources existing land use practices connected to natural resource management are poorly managed resulting in food and water insecurity furthermore because of its geographical position and climatic factors the comoros is vulnerable to natural disasters such as tropical storms floods rising sea level volcanic eruptions earthquakes and landslides the exposure to natural disasters coupled with humaninduced pressure on natural resources gives rise to the inherent vulnerability of the comorian population which will be further exacerbated under changing climatic conditions climate change is likely to adversely affect the comoros by resulting in i an increase in annual rainfall variation ii an increase in temperatures iii a rise in sea level resulting in salt water intrusion and coastal erosion and iv an increase in the frequency and severity of climatic hazards such as tropical cyclones droughts episodes of heavy rainfall and flooding existing conditions increase the vulnerability of local communities in the comoros to the abovementioned climate change effects the topography of the islands is rugged with many steep slopes and lava flows which intensify the runoff strength of rainwater in combination with fragile soils the topography causes erosion and flooding and results in the destruction of villages this is exacerbated by the unsustainable land use practices including deforestation and expanding agriculture local communities living in vulnerable areas within proximity of the sea are also exposed to coastal erosion as a result of heavy rainfall tides or sand removal furthermore climateinduced disasters including tropical cyclones and storms leading to heavy rainfall landslides rock falls and flooding affect the transport networks local communities are often cut off from food water and medical supplies as well as emergency services during such climaterelated natural disasters the project objective is to strengthen the adaptive capacity of the comorian

5478,ethiopia is a landlocked country with a population of about people of which about of whom live in rural areas the ethiopian economy has grown rapidly in the last decade primarily as a result of increased agricultural production the agricultural sector accounts for more than of total employment and of the country s gdp farming is undertaken mainly by smallscale rural farmers whose activities are often unsustainable this is because farmers are forced to cultivate land and graze livestock on steep slopes with fragile soils in order to meet daily food needs the watersheds in such mountainous land are further mismanaged through overharvesting of trees for fuel wood as a result of these factors as well as intense and infrequent rains topsoil erosion and land degradation are widespread across the ethiopian highlands climate change in ethiopia which includes rising temperatures more intense rain events greater variability of mean annual rainfall and a greater frequency of droughts and floods has greatly intensified the degradation of farmland and watersheds in ethiopia all of these climate change effects contribute to a negative cycle of reduced soil organic matter with concomitant reductions in nutrient availability and water infiltrability greater runoff of rainwater increased rates of soil erosion and reduced agricultural productivity average national temperatures have increased by c between and and rainfall during the short rainfall season is increasingly variable on both a spatial and temporal scale furthermore climate models show that the intensity and frequency of droughts and floods are likely to increase markedly over the next years local communities in the ethiopian highlands are increasingly vulnerable to the above climate change effects their agricultural productivity is being greatly impeded in particular by increased rainfall variability droughts floods soil erosion and by limited availability of surface and groundwater for irrigation and drinking needs stream flows are decreasing groundwater levels are declining mountain springs are drying up and their lakes are increasingly being silted up certain crops that were being grown in the past are no longer able to be farmed predicted future climate change will further exacerbate their vulnerability to climate change to increase the climate resilience of local communities in the

5573,the project is part of the coastal fisheries initiative programme cfi which aims to motivate a change shift towards an integrated inclusive and sustainable approach to fisheries management and development cfi will contribute to address the global issue of weak governance as a root cause of overfishing and degradation of fishery resources and coastal and marine biodiversity cfi has three projects in indonesia latin america this project and west africa a technical assistance facility to develop a pipeline of investable projects cfi challenge fund and a mechanism for global coordination and knowledge management global partnership project the present project addresses the key issue of weak fisheries governance in coastal fisheries in ecuador and peru focusing mainly on artisanal and small scale fisheries these fisheries have had an uncontrolled expansion driven mainly by increasing market demand openaccess policies deficient or lack of regulation and deficient surveillance and enforcement existing fishing pressure threaten valuable fishery resources and coastal and marine biodiversity the project objective is to demonstrate holistic ecosystembased management and improved governance of coastal fisheries in the southeast pacific this is in line with cfi theory of change and directly contributes to the programme s objective of demonstrating holistic ecosystem based management and improved governance of coastal fisheries for this the project strategy is to establish communities of practice with fishers stakeholders and authorities of both countries implement handson trials in fisheryspecific seven fisheries and areaspecific cases two sites systematically document exchange and disseminate experience and lessons within each country between both countries and among participants of cfi and apply lessons to improve existing fisheries governance schemes or to implement new ones the project has three components component will contribute to improve the enabling conditions for fisheries governance in seven coastal fisheries five in ecuador two in peru in addition the limiting factors faced by peruvian regional governments to administer marine artisanal fisheries will be analysed and trial actions for capacity building will be implemented in the regional government of tumbes and piura component will focus on improve the enabling conditions for coastal and marine spatial planning cmsp for this pilots on cmsp will be implemented in the gulf of guayaquil ecuador and sechura bay peru component will be the backbone of the learning process and will support the communities of practice of the project it will focus on exchanging lessons and best practice among stakeholders within each country among both countries and with global partners of the cfi this component will facilitate to learn from the other cfi projects to make available the experience from ecuador and peru and to measure the advance with regards to the cfi theory of changeto demonstrate holistic ecosystembased management and improved governance of coastal fisheries in the southeast pacific improved enabling conditions for fisheries governance in seven coastal

5711,the impact of climate change coupled with other human and environmental stressors is increasing degradation of wetlands and their associated ecosystem services in uganda this is negatively affecting the livelihoods of approximately million people living in and around wetland areas in fact over of the people living adjacent to wetland areas in uganda directly use wetland resources for their household food security needs given that wetlands are highly vulnerable to changes in the quantity and quality of their water supply climate change will most likely substantially alter ecologically important attributes of wetlands and will exacerbate the impacts from human activity the loss of wetlands could exacerbate the impact of climate change as they provide fundamental services that contribute to mitigation of such impacts this project seeks to support the government of uganda to take climate change issues into account when managing critical wetland areas project activities have been developed to specifically respond to and take into account specific climaterelated impacts and vulnerabilities of wetland ecosystems the barriers that prevent uganda from sustaining resilient wetland ecosystems and associated livelihoods include limited technical knowledge on the agroecological and hydrological systems of the wetlands insufficient extension services for resilient agriculture and livelihoods and inadequate climate information and early warning systems this project will restore wetlands and their ecosystem services based on wiseuse principles and guidelines as outlined by the ramsar convention on wetlands with sustainable land management practices and reforestation will support resilient agricultural practices and alternative livelihoods for communities living in these areas to reduce the pressures on the wetlands and finally will strengthen the climate information and early warning systems to support these communities to make climateresilient decisions the project will target two regions south western uganda and eastern uganda with a total population of people and land area of km at least people in and around the wetlands will directly benefit from this investment this initiative will improve the lives of some of the most vulnerable people in uganda dependent on subsistence agriculture and wetlands for their livelihoods improved sustainable management of the wetlands increased skills for employability and entrepreneurship capacities to start new businesses and accurate and reliable climate information will have a transformational impact on people s lives in the targeted areas available public financing is limiting uganda s ability to implement adaptation measures to restore critical ecosystem services for resilient livelihoods in the country consequently the government of uganda as a lowincome economy and a least developed country seeks maximum concessionality from the gcf grant resources

respective provincial governments for the first time landscape approach is adopted for the conservation of snow leopard sympatric species and their habitats in snow leopard range in northern pakistan the guidelines developed by gslep and adopted by the twelve range governments including pakistan by developing their national priorities provide foundation for the zonation of the landscapes based on ecological information this notion follows ecological principals and replaces the conventional zonation approach for the pas based on administrative boundaries as narrated under indicator ii out of the three proposed lmps one was developed the lmp explicitly identifies multiple and core areas and recommends cross cutting management measures for each of the ecological zones the plan will be submitted to the lcc for review and approval during the second half of moreover lmps for the rest of the two landscapes will be drafted by the end of multiple use landscape frameworks agreed with key stakeholders and under review for official approval indicator mandatory indicator extent to which institutional frameworks are in place for integration of conservation sustainable natural resource use control and management of wildlife crime and illegal wildlife trade and improved livelihoods into landscape planning and management achievement of this indicator is measured through the number of capacity building activities organized for the staff of the provincial government departments especially wildlife forest and environment departments in planning undertaking and monitoring of the ecological and socioeconomic attributes of the landscapes other pas and community managed conservation areas cmcas and equipping them with necessary gears to cope up with the hostile environment of

reporting period new and more stringent water quality regulations have been adopted and are already triggering new types of review e g of impacts to buffer zones earthmoving regulations and permits are under review and are being updated r n r nthis indicator is highly variable due to national and global economic situations and the scheduling of local construction for instance even though the number of eas required decreased due to the smaller nature of applied permits the number of safeguards in place increased for instance improved water quality regulations classifies and protects water bodies based on water quality and establishes an antidegradation policy improved microbiological and chemical standards added an ammonia nh toxicity standard and uses better science to set a new dissolved oxygen standard updated wastewater treatment and disposal regulations also went into force on october it set more stringent standards for acceptable standards of fecal coliform suspended

situations when many projects are small e g increased proportion of homebuilding due to increasing household incomes housing loan programs or falling tourist numbers compliance will be higher that

delay biosecurity officers however continue to screen every incoming vessel at considerable risk to themselves r n r na key sign of progress is the respect paid to the biosecurity officers during this covid crisis biosecurity officers have been recognized and feted as frontline responders by the public and businesses winning prizes and being recognized on posters recognition of their role in protecting the country is relatively new given that many of these positions were only created under this project r n r nmainstreaming of policies has improved with the establishment of biodiversity

action plans in states that were ready by june covered hectares square meters work to complete actual rehabilitation had not started by the end of june on the ground restoration work commenced in july in states r n r nthis work is progressing with partner states on babeldaob plus peleliu in the southern lagoon planning action on the ground to reforest or rehabilitate degraded lands in to facilitate these community actions planning teams are in place and functional and each planning team has a draft or final restoration action pla nthe project has provided tools and training to facilitate selection of sites writing of action plans and use of best practices r n r nin addition the project has compiled existing best practices as well as identifying many new best practices that protect biodiversity and provide social safeguards these bmps are accessible to the public via a website have been highlighted in communications to partners and have been discussed in person via technical support the project has guided the state planning teams to identify the needed support or to select the most appropriate bmps while at the same time enabling community input r n r nwhen states first began drafting action plans they sought technical advice from a variety of government ngo online and community sources and some plans included introduced plants after identifying sources of information the project worked to improve input into state plans so that restoration plans mainstream national policies and best practices now the project and its partners mnret boa bd cite the same native and non native plant policy when recommending which plants to use or which methods to use when rehabilitating land the epu actively guided states towards using native plants this indicator measures an end output of the project and thus it is too early in the project to see any changes r n r nevidence of stable or increasing populations for both species data through from soe r n pigeons

results based management and the utility of indicators the baseline will be set during the jcb spatial mapping process with a baseline set by october r n r nstates have identified small areas to begin community management action on the ground has not yet started and thus it is too early to judge changes to income or carbon action on this indicator is progressing slowly with assessments and planning for the southern lagoo nawareness of reduced fish stocks has increased and there is growing support for additional management of coastal fisheries much of that effort is being directed at the pnms shifting fishing pressure to offshore fisheries mpas remain a focus within pan but are receiving less attention than before messaging must be carefully balanced with food security being a more successful message than biodiversity conservation particularly now during the covid economic downtur na koror state planning team has been formed and has begun a collaborative review of a new rock island management plan given the complicated political and covidinfluenced economic situation in koror state having a functioning state planning team is an achievement koror state is facing a significant budget shortfall due to the border closure and crash of tourism due to covid engagement with koror state must be done carefully and with sensitivity to livelihoods and thus is progressing very slowly so far the planning team has approved goals that include better management of fisheries and reefs r n r nthere is a risk that loss of income due to covid will drive unsustainable fishing in koror waters the loss of tourism income is negatively impacting the ability of the department of conservation and law enforcement particularly the rangers to monitor and enforce r nprogress in establishing a southern lagoon jcb has also been similarly slow bylaws and sops have been created and approved but the membership has not been approved by the koror governor thus coordinated efforts by koror and peleliu to plan for fish stocks in the southern lagoon has not begu ngiven the ongoing shifts in focus as well as delays and changing needs due to covid it may become necessary to adapt the project activities under this outcome action on this indicator is progressing slowly similar to indicator shifts in needs and attention may require adaption by the project r n r nidentification of high value sites including reef sites is included in the work plan for the babeldaob jcb and mapping of high value sites will occur through both the babeldaob and southern lagoon jcb processes jcb bylaws and sops as well as the plans including identifying and designating conservation zones again messaging must proceed carefully with less discussion of biodiversity and more discussion of sustainable use given the worsening economic situatio nthe covid situation may actually enable a rebound in coral health in tourist sites although it is too early to know for sure the baseline for this indicator has been set at total nests active and inactive december r n r naction on this indicator is progressing slowly biosecurity in general has been included in a revised management plan for

serious form of transnational organized crime and efforts have been made to strengthen the law enforcement response to these crimes while cooperation with other countries is still limited partly because of weak regional networks r n r n wildlife crime can be detected by law enforcement agencies score r nthailand has sufficient capacity to detect wildlife trafficking especially through the

identify financial offences and to subsequentially send cases to amlo r n r n there is a strong legal basis to combat wildlife crime score r nthe new wildlife law have been improved version of the previous legislation it recognizes the severity of wildlife crimes and fills some of the gaps identified in the previous version of the law includes higher penalties this new law will also provide more authority for searches while the capacity to engage in mutual legal assistance with other countries is still limited r n r n wildlife crime is prosecuted in accordance with the severity of the crime score r nprosecutors do not have a specialized branch and do not receive specialized training about wildlife crime r nthere is no set of guidelines which helps to determine what is required to build an evidential case against those accused of wildlife crime r n r n wildlife crime offenders are appropriately penalized score r n penalties for wildlife crimes included in the law are sufficiently high to be a deterrent but that these penalties are rarely enforced handed down during sentencing r n r n a holistic approach is deployed to combat wildlife crime score r na clear

sound managent of pbdes from the public transport sector within the strategy the technical committee agreed to validate project goal of giving final disposal to metric tonnes of pbdes by reviewing pbdes waste calculation developed during ppg phase r n r nthis activity will be reactivated in the last quarter of considering that the covid pandemic emergency suspended all transport activity including governmental office operation the project has agreed to be formalized through a mutual cooperation agreement with the two cement companies cofinanciers to achieve the reduction of upops associated with waste streams first agricultural plastics which open burning practices happen in the central corridor for which a baseline must be generated the second waste stream is discarded textiles that are currently burned and for which there is interest in providing a proper final disposal also a baseline must be generated r nregarding the reduction of upops in a health care facility the installation of an autoclave has been prioritized as a new pilot technique to neutralize bioinfectious waste hospital escuela has been prioritized the largest in the country and with which significant progress in health care waste management was achieved by the project pims the project implemented a healthcare waste management plan and achieved important reduction of mercury added in medical devices use and block purchasing of mercury added products in the last quarter of the project signed a contract to carry out the update of the teacher s guide for the sound management of chemicals and waste became official in with the gef project pims this guide is used as an educational reference material in the teaching of natural science class in elementary and middle schools at the public and private level as of june the department of environmental and health communication and education decoas of the secretary of education reviewed the draft of the updated edition of the teacher s guide after the technical validation is obtained from the secretary of education with project support this guide will be digitally reproduced for public and private schools use in r nit is projected to develop an interactive edition of the teacher s guide to facilitate teacher s comprehension on the topic and the interaction with students as of june of terms of reference have been prepared to develop a strategy to redesign and update thematic and programmatic educational content at university level undergraduate and post graduate programs where sound management of chemicals can be inserted updated this includes a diagnostic where smc topic is taught explore how the topic can be mainstreamed and validate academic content with participatory approach with the honduran high

that are located downstream suffer the most fears of scarcity often results in overirrigation by upstream farmers leaving very limited amounts of water for the downstream farmer and pastoral communities overirrigation is often detrimental for the crops and cause secondary salinization this over reliance on irrigation system diverts the attention from water and soil conservation measures that can offer greater land and water productivity as well as greater resilience to droughts the government is becoming increasingly aware of pressures posed by drought and climate change induced reductions in water flows in response to severe droughts of the government has issued the policy measures to help minimise the losses such as fodder production establishment of greenhouses etc since it has invested million in agricultural modernisation land consolidation and infrastructure upgrade this however mainly covered private commercial farms that replaced inefficient shirkats after the

movement will be augmented and productivity of farm lands further derailed it will activate the salt migration processes the main reasons for failed attempts to encourage larger scale rehabilitation of vegetation cover and maintenance of plantations relate to the adhoc nature of such efforts that are not linked with broader view of landscape functions poorly planned coverage that do not have

demonstration meetings covered by the local and national media for adaptation advocacy while the government and rural communities are very well aware of increasing variability that is negatively affecting agricultural production and people s livelihoods there is little awareness and knowledge how to move towards climate resilient solutions this is an underlying cause of the current situation when despite some sporadically demonstrated water saving irrigation and agronomic methods take up rates are very low and the farmers continue the same inefficient and unsustainable practices that

the government of pakistan as well as the provinces of punjab and kpk a market based approach to sustainability in capacity building for environment is successfully pilot tested for replication and scaling up later a market mechanism for sourcing and supplying environmental information people across the different economic and demographic strata in pakistan have a better understanding of the environmental and of the need to protect and use it sustainably public opinion is better informed and more supportive of environmental protection and sustainability an increasing number of economic development projects befit from adequate and competent environmental impact assessment that are influential in shaping the design and course of such projects for greater sustainability enhanced and sustained political support to mainstream sustainability in economic development removing the barriers to environmental information management and mainstreaming global environment concerns into economic decision making a unified collection storage and access system for primary data managed by pakistan bureau of statistics environment data in pakistan is fragmented different organizations tend to generate and use their respective data that is seldom widely shared relatively more comprehensive data is gathered pakistan bureau of statistics but it is incomplete there are also often questions as to the reliability off data availability of adequate consistent reliable and uptodate data on pakistans environment quality assurance tools are developed and pilot tested in agencies gathering primary environment data each in punjab and kpk the quality and reliability of data including for environment in pakistan is often questioned sometimes it is a question of perception stemming from variability introduced by variation in sourcing other times the concern is real limited work if much has been done in the past to address the issue of quality and reliability if environment data quality and reliability of environment data the compendium of environmental statistics for pakistan are published regularly every year with improved contents matching the countrys environmental reporting requirements a compendium of the countrys environmental statistics is published by pakistan bureau of statistics periodically the last one was published in another one is

the nemis identified environmental data requirement the environmental reporting by the federal government is mostly based on information supplied by the provinces the provinces also sometimes produce their own environmental report profiles the information in two sets of reports is not always consistent partly due to timing and sources there is also a significant duplication of efforts consistency and complementarities in reporting environmental information by the federal government and the provinces a total of three country reports due under cbd unfcc and ccd due during the project are produced in time with enhanced content and quality pakistan has been seeking to regularly report against the three rio conventions the secretariats of the conventions often fund the preparation of these reports but the consistent availability of environmental information leaves room for improvement enhanced and improved country reporting against the three multilateral environmental agreements

assignments during the project period a lot of the research is carried out in universities but links to policy and practice are weak or missing on the other hand environmental organizations need resources for essential research to fill critical gapes in information synergy between environmental research reporting and practice a core of officers in economic development ministries and departments are exposed to the essentials of environment through workshops or seminars at respective ministries or departments and guestlectures in relevant training institutions environmental capacity in the country is limited much of what exits is in select environmental institutions of the governments and ngos officers in government ministries and departments dealing with economic

environment functions little or no attention has been paid to economic development sectors where such capacities are needed most even in the environment functions that were targeted lasting capacity
